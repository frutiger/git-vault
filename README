A transparent git repository encryption/decryption mechanism

gitvault acts as git remote that transparently encrypts and decrypts a git
repository. This is useful for transporting git repositories over unsafe means
(e.g. sneakernet) between trusted hosts.

Usage:
  1. Add the 'gitvault' repository path to your PATH environment variable
  2. Add a GITVAULT_PASSWORD environment variable that will hold the password
     used for encryption
  3. From an existing git repository, run
     $ git vault add <name> <location>
  4. Use `git push <name> <branch>` and `git fetch <name>` as usual.

<location> will now contain an encrypted version of your repository.

Notes:
  gitvault invokes `openssl enc` with
    -aes-128-cbc -pass pass:$GITVAULT_PASSWORD
  but if you want to use your own invocation, set GITVAULT_ENC_OPTIONS

Known issues:
  <location> must be an absolute path
