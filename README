A transparent git repository encryption/decryption mechanism

'git-vault' acts as a git remote that transparently encrypts and decrypts a git
repository. This is useful for transporting git repositories over unsafe means
(e.g. sneakernet) between trusted hosts.

Usage:
  1. Add 'git-vault' to your PATH
  2. From an existing git repository (init it if you need to), run:
     $ git vault add <name> <location>
  3. Set your vault password:
     $ git config vault.<name>.password <password>
  4. Use `git push <name> <branch>` and `git fetch <name>` as usual.
  5. If you want to remove the vault:
     $ git vault rm <name>

<location> will now contain an encrypted version of your repository.

Notes:
  'git-vault' invokes `openssl enc` with:
    -aes-128-cbc -pass pass:<password>
  but if you want to use your own invocation, set the options yourself:
    git config vault.<name>.enc-options "<options>"
